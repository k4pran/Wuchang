A place near [[Tower of Sacrifice]]

Once a place for disposing of corpses.

[[Luo]] set it afire, but the fire became unnatural and blocked all passage. The only way to it after was the secret passage via [[Shu Sanctum]] in [[The Underground Palace]] where bandits made a trail through
Okay, this is a rich tapestry of interconnected lore! Let's break down the characters and locations mentioned, focusing on their connections.

## Characters

*   **Lu You San:** The central figure handling funerals (his own daughter Lu Hongliu, Chang Da, Li Chang). He seeks power to resurrect his daughter or perhaps for other reasons. Known as a gravekeeper.
*   **Luo:** An official in Worship's Rise who rallied people and led an attack against monsters at Luo Estate. Survived the assault by trapping and setting fire to beasts (unnatural fire).
*   **Wuchang:** A key character involved with Lu Hongliu, The Great Centipede, Huang Jian'e, Yu Xia, Nian Suichang, and the steampowered spears from Zhenwu Temple. Seems connected to the "Feathering" phenomenon.
*   **Huang Jian'e:** A woman seeking revenge against Lu Hongliu for killing her companions. She blames The Trinity Bell. Taoist background (or former). Received help from Wuchang indirectly by avenging her brothers through Lu Hongliu's death.
*   **Lu Bingzhang:** An alchemist bound to the Feathering cult, possibly corrupted by Red Mercury whispers. Trapped Imperial Guards under Shu Sanctum. Succumbed late to Feathering.
*   **Nian Suichang:** Brother of Qiao Lin and son of Qiao Ying. Son of a local in Lightzen Temple (Wan). Wants elixirs for his brother from Wuchang at Shu Sanctum. Received "mercurial blood" after Lu Bingzhang's defeat.
*   **Qiao Lin:** Nian Suichang's brother, transformed into the "dancing flame thing." Wife is Feng Xiaoyan (or someone similar), mentioned via memorial tablet in Lightzen Temple.
*   **Qiao Ying:** Mother of Qiao Lin and presumably Nian Suichang. She gave Wuchang a White Jade Dumpling earlier. Lives at Luo Estate.
*   **Yang Zongbao:** Husband of Mu Guiying, father of twins (Arhat). His dough figurine was given to the Arhat by Wuchang in Lightzen Temple.
*   **Mu Guiying:** Wife of Yang Zongbao. Her dough figurine was fought and killed by Wuchang at Lightzen Temple.
*   **Feng Xiaoyan:** Wife of someone (possibly Yang Zongbao?). Memorial tablet found for her in Lightzen Temple.
*   **Bo People:** A group linked to madness, demons, and the Bo bloodline. Legend connects their blood to sea lilies granting strength but at a cost.

## Locations

1.  **Worship's Rise:**
    *   [[Luo Estate]] - Headquarters for Luo, where people gathered before attacking monsters.
    *   [[Bamboo Courtyard]] - Location in Worship's Rise with the theatre troupe and connection to Bo people kidnapping Yang Zongbao parents.

2.  **Shu Sanctum:**
    *   Central location housing the secret passage to Cloudspire (formerly accessible via disposal).
    *   Underground Vaults/Cloudspire/Bandit Caves - Locations within or near Shu Sanctum.
    *   [[Red Mercury Workshop]] - Secret location under Shu Sanctum for Lu Bingzhang's experiments.
    *   Possesses artifacts like the **Clerical Robes** (linked to Magus whispers), **The Trinity Bell** (originally, now with Huang Jian'e?), and potentially other relics mentioned in letters.

3.  **Cloudspire:**
    *   Mentioned as having Ming's army stationed there.
    *   Site of the Rebel March noted below it.

4.  **Lightzen Temple:**
    *   Home to Wuchang, who received a "Draw circle" pose from an Arhat after giving him Yang Zongbao's dough figurine.
    *   Possesses steampowered spears and fixed origin pills (or similar protective items).

5.  **The Underground Palace:** Location housing the Tower of Sacrifice.

6.  **Tower of Sacrifice:** A place near Cloudspire, once used for disposing corpses, now blocked by unnatural fire linked to Luo or Lu Hongliu's actions? Also mentioned as a sacrifice site for Ancient Shu.

7.  **Doomwillow Beach:**
    *   Where Chen You was accidentally poisoned and disposed of.
    *   Location where Luo might have set the mountain ablaze (according to Xuanyangzi).
    *   Possibly linked to Lu Hongliu's growth or research notes.

8.  **The Great Centipede:** Boss residing in The Underground Palace, feeding on Taoists (including disciples from Zhenwu Temple). Originated from Ancient Shu times, possibly tied to the Jade Circada for Lu Hongliu and the unnatural fire at Tower of Sacrifice/Cloudspire.

9.  **Reverent Temple:**
    *   Mentioned in a letter by Honglan about Yu Xia's planned meeting point.
    *   Site where the Golden Bandits (one of Three Blights) might have operated or been heading to.

10. **Primordial Deity:** Associated with scattered Avian essence forming Goldwings, via Wuchang's "Significant Other" and Bo people legend.

## Key Connections & Questions

*   **Who is going to Cloudspire?**
    *   The text explicitly states: `[[Nian Suichang]] is heading here as he heard people of there are in need of help.` So Nian Suichang knows about the situation at Cloudspire and intends to go.
    *   Also mentioned: `A note below in the mines of [[Shu Sanctum]] mentions rebels marching on [[Cloudspire]]` - This implies some group (perhaps related to the Bo people or Feathering) is approaching Cloudspire militantly. However, it doesn't specify who these "rebels" are.
*   **The Great Centipede:** It's implied that this monster was originally from Ancient Shu times and gained abilities by feeding on Taoists in The Underground Palace after Lu Bingzhang's negligence allowed the cult to flourish there.
*   **Lu Hongliu & Luo:** There seems to be a connection between Luo setting an unnatural fire at Cloudspire/Tower of Sacrifice and Lu Hongliu gaining power. It might be related, perhaps even her origin or growth trigger.
*   **Huang Jian'e's Quest:** She seeks revenge against Lu Hongliu for killing her companions in The Underground Palace during the exorcism attempt that failed. Her connection to The Trinity Bell is unclear (maybe it was Master of Shu's?), but she blames it and wants it back or destroyed? She also heads towards Cloudspire.
*   **Lu Bingzhang:** He trapped Imperial Guards under Shu Sanctum, possibly intending to deliver them to Ming for his elixirs. This negligence might have enabled the Feathering cultists' activities in The Underground Palace.

## Summary

The most direct character mentioned as going to Cloudspire is [[Nian Suichang]]. There's also implication of a group ("rebels") marching on it, likely related to the [[Feathering]] or [[Bo]] people. Other characters like Luo and Wuchang have strong connections but aren't explicitly stated to be heading there themselves (though Luo might know about it from his escape).
