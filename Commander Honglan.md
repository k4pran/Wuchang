Signed a letter written for a [[Reverent Temple]] maiden [[Yu Xia]].

It mentions [[Commander Honglan]] sent his subordinates to the palace, and to keep an eye on the [[Burning Cave]] and mentions securing some relic. Planned to meet back at [[Reverent Temple]].

The letter was bloodstained so likely the messenger was killed by [[Lu Bingzhang]] before it got to the maiden, [[Yu Xia]] was downstairs of the [[Reverent Temple]]. [[Wuchang]] ended up giving the letter to [[Yu Xia]]. 

The letter was found at top of [[Shu Sanctum]] where some succumbed to late-stage [[Feathering]] and there was blood everywhere so the letter didn't make it out of [[Shu Sanctum]]

Has some command or say over the [[Ming Dynasty]] army it seems

Noticed that [[Wuchang]] was of Bai lineage

A secret letter found on a rebel leader at the camp in [[Cloudspire]] mentioned [[Commander Honglan]] had retrieved the "treasure" from a woman and then set out to [[Cloudspire]] at night
