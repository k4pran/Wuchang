Signed a letter written for a [[Reverent Temple]] maiden [[Yu Xia]].

It mentions [[Commander Honglan]] sent his subordinates to the palace, and to keep an eye on the [[Burning Cave]] and mentions securing some relic. Planned to meet back at [[Reverent Temple]].

The letter was bloodstained so likely the messenger was killed by [[Lu Bingzhang]] before it got to the maiden, [[Yu Xia]] was downstairs of the [[Reverent Temple]]. [[Wuchang]] ended up giving the letter to [[Yu Xia]]. 

The letter was found at top of [[Shu Sanctum]] where some succumbed to late-stage [[Feathering]] and there was blood everywhere so the letter didn't make it out of [[Shu Sanctum]]

Has some command or say over the [[Ming Dynasty]] army it seems

Noticed that [[Wuchang]] was of Bai lineage

A secret letter found on a rebel leader at the camp in [[Cloudspire]] mentioned [[Commander Honglan]] had retrieved the "treasure" from a woman and then set out to [[Cloudspire]] at night

She found a "Wooden strip" during her search of [[Shu]] and handed it to [[Duke Liu Cheng'en]] for safe keeping

Ultimate goal along with [[Duke Liu Cheng'en]] was to restore the [[Tang Emperor]] and revive the [[Ming Dynasty]]

She now seems to be leading the imperial guards in [[Cloudspire]] from the [[Tang Emperor Palace]]

Was imprisoned in [[Shaft]] and happy that [[Madam Huang Yan|Madame]] was dead

Succumbed to [[Feathering]] after battling [[Red-Clad Lady]] and was killed by [[Wuchang]]. She kept mentioning her maiden [[Yu Xia]] as she died.

She had an ice crystal that was used by [[Tang Emperor]] to stave of fever in his last days before bestowing it on his favourite concubine, not sure how [[Commander Honglan]] got it unless the concubine was [[Yu Xia]]? At a guess [[Yu Xia]] give it to [[Commander Honglan]] as she became sick with [[Feathering]]
