Met at [[Shu Sanctum]]

Met again at [[Cloudspire]]

Seemed to be arguing with something inside himself

Said the only lighting two beacons is the only way for [[Wuchang]] to reach [[Cloudspire]]

Met again near the forest at [[Mt Zhenu]], his mission seems to be hunting some monster or demon he is tracking and tracked it to this forest, asked [[Wuchang]] help in defeating it.

He owned the [[Cyan Feather Chisel]]. He commanded his army in a clash against the [[Feathering]] monsters and emerged victorious claiming this chisel. But the fallen soldiers and beasts of the forest transformed into haunting nightmares that plagued him ever since.

A legend, a general who led a vast host

Vanquished foes apparently around the cave of [[Hillswatch]] shielding the descendents of [[Shu]] from harm

Created peace in [[Shu]], had a might steed
