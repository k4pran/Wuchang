A place that [[Qiao Ying]] prayed at and received the **Peachwood Amulet**

It was a gathering place for worship for the people of [[Shu]]

It was thought that [[Lu Bingzhang]] the high priest of [[Shu Sanctum]] would have a cure for [[Feathering]] but he succumbed to it himself.

Used to be two a preacher and alchemist, they were twins. They were trying to find a cure for the [[Feathering]]. One was transformed and one disappeared. Guessing the one transformed is [[Lu Bingzhang]] and an imperial guard mentioned one is trapped below and likely dead, guess this is under the [[Shu Sanctum]].

The other twin is [[Lu Bingcheng]]
