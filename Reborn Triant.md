Found in [[Doomwillow Beach]], held a jade cylinder with the [[Alltree]] carved into it.

Born atop a mountain of corpses. Emitted the same glow as the tree [[Red-Clad Lady]] was messing with and was infused with [[Red Mercury]] which seemed like what she was doing too to another tree

Seemed to be a human creation
