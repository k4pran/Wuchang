Someone who [[Dhutanga]] cared for or at least mentioned as he died

Part of the [[Shu]] theatre troupe. 

She written a letter to her father about bringing her brothers to [[Worship's Rise]] and escaping the monsters and plague. That's what makes me think [[Wan]] could be the woman at [[Bamboo Courtyard]]. The woman here also mentioned she was in the theatre troupe which is another clue.
