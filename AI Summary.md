**You are an expert assistant specializing in guiding users through a rich narrative tapestry centered around [[Shu]], its history, characters, locations, and mystical elements. Your primary role is to help users explore this intricate world by providing contextually appropriate information based on their queries or scenarios related to the lore provided.**

**Context Summary:** The setting revolves around the ancient and powerful entity of [[Shu]], marked by themes of sacrifice, madness, resurrection, hidden paths, and the resurgence of forgotten powers like the **[[Feathering]]** plague. Key figures include [[Lu Hongliu]], an infamous gravekeeper turned monstrosity; [[Lu Bingzhang]], a high priest consumed by forbidden knowledge (possibly involving [[Red Mercury]]); [[Wuchang]], a protagonist navigating this world with artifacts and allies; [[The Trinity Bell]], a relic capable of dispelling madness but now sought after or distrusted; and the **[[Three Blights]]** that plague [[Shu]]. Locations such as [[Doomwillow Beach]], [[Bamboo Courtyard]], [[Red Mercury Workshop]], [[Bandit Caves]], and [[Cloudspire]] are central to this lore, each holding secrets tied to characters or events.

**Main Objective:** To generate responses that effectively guide users through the complexities of the [[Shu]] narrative. This involves providing context for character backgrounds, explaining location significance, detailing artifact properties, and outlining potential plot threads or consequences based on user input.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Style & Tone:** Maintain a tone that is informative yet immersive, blending historical detail with mystical elements. Be precise in describing lore but allow flexibility for storytelling interpretations.
2.  **Target Audience:** Primarily users engaged in role-playing games (RPGs), narrative-driven simulations, or creative writing inspired by the [[Shu]] universe. Assume familiarity with core concepts like characters, locations, and artifacts mentioned above.
3.  **Response Format:**
    *   For direct lore queries (e.g., "What is the [[Feathering]]?"), provide concise explanations integrating key details from the context without excessive fluff unless prompted for narrative style.
    *   When asked to explore a scenario or location, generate branching narratives or descriptive passages that outline possibilities and consequences. Use elements like dialogue snippets, environmental cues, and character reactions based on provided lore (e.g., [[Wuchang]]'s circle pose).
    *   For questions about characters, provide detailed backstories, motivations, relationships, and potential outcomes for their actions, referencing their known connections to events or artifacts.
    *   When detailing an artifact's use or effect, describe the process clearly but concisely. Mention associated risks (e.g., madness from [[Red Mercury]]) or side effects if relevant to the context.
    *   For tactical advice within a game scenario involving specific locations or characters, provide step-by-step guidance based on known lore and potential challenges.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Consistency:** Ensure consistency with established character traits (e.g., [[Lu Hongliu]]'s connection to funerals), location descriptions (e.g., [[The Underground Palace]] as a place for Taoist rituals turned dark), and artifact properties.
*   **Depth:** Provide enough detail to be useful but avoid overwhelming the user unless they explicitly ask for more depth or examples. Focus on integrating the provided context effectively.
*   **Flexibility:** Adapt your narrative style based on the user's preference if indicated (e.g., shifting from formal explanation to a more atmospheric description). Be prepared to handle questions about cause-and-effect relationships between events, characters, and locations.

**Example Interaction (Conceptual - not part of the prompt):**

User: "What happens when [[Wuchang]] uses the circle pose on [[Lu Hongliu]]?"
You (LLM): "[[Shu]] Lorekeeper Response: The act described involves [[Wuchang]] confronting [[Lu Hongliu]], likely at a critical moment. Using the 'Draw Circle' pose, possibly inherited or learned from allies like [[Arhat]], triggers an energy discharge associated with Taoist exorcism rituals (referencing fixed origin pills). This could manifest as: 1) A surge of spiritual energy pushing back [[Lu Hongliu]]'s monstrous aura temporarily. 2) Intense pain for [[Wuchang]] due to the backlash from [[Lu Hongliu]]'s unnatural state or potential connection to [[Feathering]]. 3) The circle potentially binding [[Lu Hongliu]] further, perhaps triggering his protective mechanisms (like the centipede's reaction). Consequences might include [[Lu Hongliu]] seeking retribution against [[Wuchang]], revealing more about the artifact used, or causing unforeseen disturbances in the nearby locations like [[Doomwillow Beach]]."

# Tower of Sacrifice

The **Tower of Sacrifice** stands near [[Doomwillow Beach]], once serving merely as a disposal site for corpses. Its significance deepens with the arrival of [[Lu Hongliu]] and her connection to the nearby tower.

## Context: The Great Centipede's Lair

It is revealed that this location may have been linked to **[[The Great Centipede]]**, which resided in the vicinity or perhaps even within its depths. The centipede, a monstrous entity bound by ancient forces, gained power from feeding on fallen Taoists and absorbing their life force.

## Connection: Lu Hongliu's Origin

Some accounts suggest that [[Lu Hongliu]]'s journey might have begun here, near the **[[Tower of Sacrifice]]**. The unnatural fire she experienced could be tied to this place or perhaps another event entirely.

---

# Luo Estate

The **Luo Estate** is a location in [[Worship's Rise]]. It was involved in an attack led by [[Luo]], who rallied people there for an assault on the beasts, possibly including [[The Great Centipede]]].

## Context: Luo's Role and Fate

[[Luo]] appears to be an official from [[Worship's Rise]]. He survived his estate being attacked. His actions involved heading to locations like [[Doomwillow Beach]] to deal with monsters.

Located somewhere within the **[[Shu Sanctum]]**, specifically mentioned in a letter found there, this cave is shrouded in mystery and danger related to the **[[Feathering]]** affliction. Its purpose or nature remains unclear from available information.
```

```markdown
## Context: Feathering Outpost

The **Burning Cave** might be considered one of the locations associated with the spread or manifestation of the **[[Feathering]]**, perhaps a place where individuals succumbed to its influence.

# The Trinity Bell

This artifact is central to several narratives. It was originally owned by [[Master of Shu]], who possessed the ability to dispel madness, likely referring to [[The Primordial Deity]]. Its current state seems corrupted or altered.

## Context: Dispersal and Corruption

It appears that **[[The Trinity Bell]]** has fallen from its original purpose. After Taoists were killed while using it, it changed hands, eventually ending up with [[Lu Hongliu]]. Later, [[Wuchang]] retrieved it during his conflict with her.

---

# The Great Centipede (Boss)

A powerful monster encountered in **[[The Underground Palace]]** or nearby locations like the **[[Tower of Sacrifice]]**, its lair is a place near [[Doomwillow Beach]].

He seems to be a central character navigating the conflicts between humans, monsters, and divine entities. He possesses items like the **[[Yang Zongbao]]** dough figurine and received information about elixirs from [[Nian Suichang]]. His name might be partially revealed as "Sankhara Wuchang" in some contexts.

## Context: Boss and Attempts

He's listed as one of two bosses, also with 12 attempts against him (though this might be a shared count or specific to him). His background involves elixirs, red mercury, and the **[[Feathering]]** affliction. He trapped the Imperial Guard under [[Shu Sanctum]], possibly related to his experiments.

---

# Lu Hongliu

A central character whose fate is tied to death and transformation. She died young, became a monstrosity (possibly [[The Great Centipede]]]), and her father [[Lu Bingsan]] sought to resurrect her through forbidden means involving **[[Red Mercury]]** or similar elixirs.

## Context: Death and Transformation

Her story involves multiple deaths handled by her father. She was killed while confronting the Taoists at [[Zhenwu Temple]], possibly during an exorcism attempt on [[The Great Centipede]]. Her final form is a monstrous centipede, suggesting a transformation process linked to death or elixirs.

---

# Lu Yousan

A character defined by his relationship with his daughter [[Lu Hongliu]] and son-in-law [[Chen You]]. He handled funerals for several individuals mentioned in the context.

## Context: Funeral Director and Resurrectionist

He was shunned by townsfolk due to his profession as a gravekeeper. His primary goal seems to be resurrecting his deceased daughter, leading him down a dark path involving elixirs and human flesh. This quest might have inadvertently caused her transformation or connection to the **[[Feathering]]**.

---

# The Brigand Massacre

One of the **[[Three Blights]]**, this infestation involved bandits attacking [[Shu]]. It shares its name with locations like [[Bandit Caves]], suggesting a direct link. This blight is part of the larger conflict involving [[Worship's Rise]] and [[Shu Sanctum]].

---

# The Underground Palace

A significant location where **[[Lu Bingzhang]]** trapped the Imperial Guard, and where **[[Huang Jian'e]]** sought materials for refining elixers. It also houses **[[The Great Centipede]]**.

## Context: Hub of Activity and Danger

This place is a focal point for several key events related to [[Shu]]. Taoists used it as a base or traveled through it, seeking powerful artifacts like the **[[Trinity Bell]]** or dealing with dangerous entities. It's also connected to [[The Underground Palace]], which might be synonymous or very closely linked.

---

# The Feathering

This is an affliction that seems to have been unleashed upon the world due to actions by figures like [[Lu Bingzhang]]. It involves madness, transformation (possibly into creatures like [[Bo]]), and death. References are made through artifacts, locations, and characters' fates.

## Context: Affliction and Consequences

The **[[Feathering]]** is a blight itself or perhaps the name of the monster plague that followed the **[[Brigand Massacre]]**. It's associated with madness whispered by [[Lu Bingzhang]], human sacrifices, and the transformation of individuals like [[Wan]]'s parents or possibly [[Goldwing]]. The **[[Shu Sanctum]]** key bearing "Great Feathered One" points to its significance.

---

# Shu Sanctum

A crucial location in [[Worship's Rise]], housing powerful artifacts and entities. It contains the **[[The Trinity Bell]]]**, a secret passage leading to [[Doomwillow Beach]], and is linked to the **[[Feathering]]** blight via trapped individuals and their letters.

## Context: Sacred Site Compromised

Originally a place of power for Taoists in [[Shu]], it seems its protective wards have been breached or corrupted. It's now associated with danger, forbidden experiments (like those by [[Lu Bingzhang]]]), and the tragic fate of figures like [[Honglan]] whose messages might not have reached their intended destinations.

---

# Bo

These individuals are linked to **[[The Feathering]]** and possess a connection to madness or demonic influence. Their blood is said to waken latent power, suggesting involvement in rituals or being affected by the blight.

## Context: Affected Bloodline

They seem like a distinct group whose members succumbed to the **[[Feathering]]]**. The transformation of individuals into [[Bo]] form might be a consequence or goal of the affliction's spread.
```

```markdown
---

# Primordial Deity (Artifact)

This entity is referenced through artifacts and lore, particularly via the **[[Trinity Bell]]**. It fell long ago, but its essence persists in some form.

## Context: Divine Entity Corrupted

Its connection to madness suggests it might be a source or counterforce to that affliction. The transformation of [[Goldwing]] from an Avian's essence points towards potential divine corruption linked to the **[[Feathering]]]**.

---

# Red Mercury (Artifact)

A dangerous substance mentioned in relation to [[Lu Bingzhang]], whose experiments with it seem to have corroded his mind. It's also referenced as being sought by [[Nian Suichang]] for healing purposes, indicating its complex and potentially dual-use nature.

## Context: Forbidden Substance

It appears highly potent but corrupting, used in elixirs that grant power at a great cost (as seen with Lu Bingzhang). Its connection to the **[[Feathering]]]** is implied through his transformation.
```

```markdown
---

# Yang Zongbao (Artifact)

A dough figurine of [[Yang Zongbao]], possibly an ancestor or figure associated with [[Lightzen Temple]]. It was given by [[Wuchang]].

## Context: Figurine and Legacy

Its specific significance isn't detailed, but it's part of the items exchanged between characters. The mention of a wife for Yang Zongbao suggests this might be one half of a pair or family unit story.
```

---

# Avian (Artifact)

These creatures are referenced through [[Goldwing]], which transformed from their essence after an ancient fall.

## Context: Winged Affliction

They seem like beings associated with the sky and perhaps divine entities. Their essence, when scattered, can transform into a **[[Bo]]** form or something similar ([[Goldwing]]]), suggesting vulnerability to certain forces (like [[Red Mercury]]]) or connection to the **[[Feathering]]]** blight.

---

# Annalum

This name appears in context alongside [[Worship's Rise]], possibly referring to an individual or entity within that location. Their role and significance are unclear from the provided snippets.
```

---

# Goldwing (Artifact)

A creature transformed from the essence of an **[[Avian]]**, these beings roam the skies, associated with the ongoing presence or influence of the **[[Primordial Deity]]**.

## Context: Scattered Essence

They seem like a consequence of the fall of powerful entities. Their mournful wails are interpreted as signs by some, tying back to the belief in [[The Primordial Deity]]'s survival.
```

# The information provided outlines a complex and dark fantasy setting involving themes of sacrifice, forbidden knowledge (elixirs), dangerous artifacts like **[[Red Mercury]]** and **[[Trinity Bell]]**, monstrous transformations (**[[Feathering]]]**), and the blight affecting [[Worship's Rise]], [[Shu Sanctum]], and potentially [[Lightzen Temple]]. Key figures like [[Lu Bingzhang]] and [[Lu Hongliu]] seem to be driving forces or consequences of this dark path, while characters like [[Wuchang]] are actively navigating it. Locations such as the **[[Tower of Sacrifice]]** and **[[The Underground Palace]]** serve as physical manifestations or points of reference for these conflicts.
