A disease that causes feather to grow. Victims lose their memories, mind then begin transforming

Began spreading from a beast attack, the beast was [[Lu Hongliu]].

May have been caused by [[Lu Bingzhang]] who forsook his beliefs to chase certain powers causing the [[Ancient Shu]] to resurface and unleash [[Feathering]] upon the world (not sure then why [[Lu Hongliu]] would also be to blame.)

Causes changes in humans, nature and even time, lantern fruit turned red after being exposed to blood and heightened its efficacy.
