Mother of [[Qiao Lin]] and [[Nian Suichang]]

Owned the **peachwood amulet** that [[Qiao Lin]] give to [[Wuchang]]. Got it from praying at [[Shu Sanctum]]

She was happy to hear of [[Lu Hongliu]]'s death. She is interested in the **white jade dumpling** [[Lu Hongliu]] has been chewing on

[[Wuchang]] give her the **White Jade Dumpling**

Thinks her son is at [[Cloudspire]] because [[Qiao Lin]] wanted her to think him a hero instead of lying at the [[Reverent Temple]], so she is heading there to meet him (while chewing on dumplings)
