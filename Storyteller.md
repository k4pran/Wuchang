An old man met at a cave near [[Lightzen Temple]] and introduced [[Wuchang]] to [[Panda]]

Met again at [[Shaft]] where he warned [[Wuchang|Bai Wuchang]] not to venture any further. He warned the lower parts of [[Snowfall Palace]] lies an unimaginable power and to no give in to avarice, but instead break their will.

The powerful artifact he was talking about was the [[Jade Ancient Chisel]]

Used to be involved with [[Zhenwu Temple]] folk. Came back to look up some old manuscripts.

He turned out to be a deity, king of [[Ancient Shu]]

After a fight with [[Bieling]] the shards ([[Ancient Chisel]] etc) were scattered.
