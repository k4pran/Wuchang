Met at [[Worship's Rise]]

Seems to know about powers of the [[Feathering]]

Met again at [[Doomwillow Beach]] and she seemed to be infusing a tree of corpses with [[Red Mercury]], similar to what happened to [[Reborn Triant|Soulwood]]

Said she was sent by the [[Primordial Deity]]. Seems to be unboard with wiping out the "worthless" to restore the world.

According to [[Storyteller]] the [[Bo Magus]] was responsible for the red vines growing on the surface at [[Worship's Rise]], it should only grow deep underground

Brought the [[Bo]] people to [[Worship's Rise]], the ancient people were brought here by [[Bo Magus]] which was reaping havoc. Apparently she was seduced by power

Led the [[Bo]] people down a dark path as she tried to restore the [[Bo]] people to their former glory, she still had unwavering loyalty to [[God of Shu]]

Hiding in [[The Underground Palace]] at [[Shu Sanctum]]

Killed by [[Wuchang]] in [[The Underground Palace]]
