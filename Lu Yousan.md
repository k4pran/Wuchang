Father of [[Lu Hongliu]]. 

He carved the **Jade Circada for her**

He was shunned by townsfolk due to his profession as gravekeeper

His daughter [[Lu Hongliu]] died young and he sought a way to resurrect her, but she became a monstrosity

Died in a raging fire, seems this could be the fire at [[Doomwillow Beach]] lead by [[Luo]], it didn't kill [[Lu Hongliu]] though and she ended up at [[Luo Estate]]

Handled the funeral of [[Chen You]] who was poisoned and handled funerals and rites of many others

Seems when his wife and daughter died during childbirth, he was given an elixir by some sage, he found that human flesh was the key to her growth and as he was a grave keeper he could supply her with corpses. He written notes of her progress at [[Doomwillow Beach]] which could be where he kept her?
