Sister of [[Wuchang]]

Loves candied haws for their sweet and sour taste. She and [[Wuchang]] have memories of these as children

[[Wuchang]] was muttering her name after being unconscious from the fight with [[Commander Honglan]]

Was concerned for her mothers help, so requested an elixer from their leader to strengthen her mother. Her father was however worried for the unborn boy and let his wife grow weeker
