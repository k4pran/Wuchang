# Story

Received a manuscript written on silk from a friend saying they would meet her at [[Worship's Rise]]

She carries a sword called "**[[Cloudfrost's Edge]]**", forged by a legendary swordsmith in the land of [[Shu]]. It gets its name from the flaming pattern representing the mountain range with peaks of white akin to frozen summits.

She was searching for clues about her sister [[Bai Yu]] at [[Worship's Rise]] before she was attacked, she wrote to [[He Youzai]] about it.


[[Commander Honglan]] noticed [[Wuchang]] was of Bai lineage

Research notes from [[Snowfall Palace]] suggest that the resurrection method being used here was somehow tied to the bai family and a curious object seems to have played a role

Set [[Commander Honglan]] free in [[Shaft]], [[Commander Honglan]] said their debt is settled but not to expect mercy on their next meeting

Here sister [[Bai Yu]] gifted her a pinwheel.

She had a brother but not sure yet what happened to him - [[Bai Kru]], he was resurrected with the incomplete relic so became a [[Feathering]] monster.

[[He Youzai]] suggested we need all four ancient chisels to resurrect [[Bai Yu]] correctly
