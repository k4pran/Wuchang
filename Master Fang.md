The Apothecary (Medicine merchant)

Father of [[Fang Yao]] and [[Fang Ling]]

Not sure who this was yet, but at [[Cloudspire]] in [[Hillswatch]] there is a tomb.

A [[Shu]] silk scarf embroidered in flowers with a short poem about camelias and the spring from the daughter was left at the tomb to remember her father. She was unable to say goodbye to him so left this as a token - by goodbye this didn't mean dead as she didn't know he had died, I guess they parted ways at some point

Guess he could be "Ling Yao"?

He taught a nursery rhyme to his daughter

"Fine shears the smithies forge for my sister, then off they trot to the bustling tavern. Rest my dear, she whispers to me: yet here I must linger, deep down in the cavern" - something about sheers being a tool to help them escape the cavern

The poem was written on a bloodied letter outside the [[Snowfall Palace]], not sure how it got there when his tomb is the other side of [[Cloudspire]] - I know now as it was [[Fang Ling]] (his other daughter and [[Fang Yao]]'s sister) that had the letter when she got lost down the cavern
