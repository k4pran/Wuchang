A demon that attacked [[Wuchang]]

Daughter of [[Lu Yousan]]

[[Qiao Ying]] said she naws on some small strange meat called [[White Jade Dumpling]]
 and can never get enough.
 
[[Qiao Ying]] said she became a man-eating fiend and blamed her father for it, said she had been feeding on the dead.

Her father was the grave keeper of [[Worship's Rise]] and carved a jade cicada with care to bless his daughter.

Seemed she had some kind of rebirth which brought calamity, maybe dies and was brought back by her father?

Her father died in a fire and she mourned him even in her monster form

Found some notes about her high up in a cliff at [[Doomwillow Beach]]. Mentions her and her mother lost at childbirth, then a sage gifted an elixir recipe, by nightfall human flesh became the key (guess this was her father feeding her human flesh). Mentions her growth was an unnatural rate, then it mentions villagers gossiping about the elixir and says they need to flee. Think this is [[Lu Yousan]] writing this, makes sense to finding it at [[Doomwillow Beach]] as he was a grave keeper and this is where corpses were disposed of.
