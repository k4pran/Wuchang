A woman [[Wuchang]] met at [[Worship's Rise]]

She led people disciples to [[The Underground Palace]] and seeks revenge against [[Lu Hongliu]] so I guess it killed her companions there? She also blames [[The Trinity Bell]]

It seems she may be a taoist and she and her disciples tried to exorcise the [[The Great Centipede]], but all died except her in doing it.

Said the [[The Trinity Bell]] is her master's, maybe [[Master of Shu]]?

Thanks [[Wuchang]] for avenging her brothers by killing [[Lu Hongliu]]. Said she is heading to [[Cloudspire]]

Met again at [[Cloudspire]]

She is now the last disciple of [[Zhenwu Temple]]. She said it was the rebels that tore her temple apart

Asked [[Wuchang]] to deliver something to someone called "Li" (I know a few Li's)
