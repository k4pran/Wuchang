A woman [[Wuchang]] met at [[Worship's Rise]]

She led people disciples to [[The Underground Palace]] and seeks revenge against [[Lu Hongliu]] so I guess it killed her companions there? She also blames [[The Trinity Bell]]

It seems she may be a taoist and she and her disciples tried to exorcise the [[The Great Centipede]], but all died except her in doing it.

Said the [[The Trinity Bell]] is her master's, maybe [[Master of Shu]]?

Thanks [[Wuchang]] for avenging her brothers by killing [[Lu Hongliu]]. Said she is heading to [[Cloudspire]]

Met again at [[Cloudspire]]

She is now the last disciple of [[Zhenwu Temple]]. She said it was the rebels that tore her temple apart

Asked [[Wuchang]] to deliver the [[Zhenwu Temple]] tome to [[Li Wansan]], a treasurer of [[Snowfall Palace]]. He had been trying to get the tomb for a while now. 

[[Wuchang]] give her the "Red Mercury Crystal" that she got from [[Li Wansan]] and she said he her business is concluded so she will return to [[Zhenwu Temple]]

She fought the rebels at [[Zhenwu Temple]]

Helped [[Wuchang]] kill the resurrected [[Zhang Xianzhong]] but died in the battle (maybe)
