Father of [[Wuchang]] and [[Bai Yu]] and [[Bai Kru]]

[[Commander Honglan]] mentioned she spared [[Wuchang]] for [[Bai Tingzhao]]'s sake

I think his wife died in childbirth and son was resurrected as a monster, similar to what happened to [[Lu Hongliu]] and [[Lu Yousan]]

In a note he mentioned losing his wife in childbearth, resurrected son and disappeared daughters. He mentioned too the treasures of [[Zhenwu Temple]] are his which could include an ancient chisel. He vowed to eradicate "this abomination" as penance, guessing its his resurrected son

A mayor of a town

Once owner of [[Cloudfrost's Edge]]

Could this be [[Bai Tingzhao]] [[Commander Honglan]] was talking about?

Commissioned an artisan to create a dragon-fish pendant as a birthday present for [[Bai Yu]]

Served in the imperial guards.

Apparently he was somehow manipulated by those in power, leaving him consumed by obsession. He wanted a son to continue his lineage so used his position to steal the relic from the [[Zhenwu Temple]] to resurrect [[Bai Kru]] after he had died.

According to [[Yu Xia]] he quelled a rebellion for the emperor
