Ordered the [[Ming Dynasty]] army to advance on [[Worship's Rise]], seemingly to defend the [[Shu Sanctum]] priests and residents

General of the [[Ming Dynasty]] army at [[Cloudspire]]

Last one to have the "Wooden Strip" before it was taken by [[Wuchang]] after the battle. He originally acquired it from [[Commander Honglan]] for safe keeping. Not sure what exactly it is, [[Tao Qing]] said he never came across anything like it, could be related to resurrection?

[[Duke Liu Cheng'en]] was charged by the emperor for the protection of [[Cloudspire]] and to oversee the [[Snowfall Palace]], after the fall of the empire, he could have easily taken control but was loyal and kept on the quest for resurrection for the [[Tang Emperor]].

Ultimate goal along with [[Commander Honglan]] was to restore the [[Tang Emperor]] and revive the [[Ming Dynasty]]
