High priest of [[Shu Sanctum]]

His cane was passed down from [[Ancient Shu]] where he hails from.

Brued elixirs, which people were suspicious of. Seems he dabbled a lot in [[Red Mercury]] which corroded his mind.

Succumbed to late [[Feathering]] and may have killed [[Commander Honglan]] (or the courier) preventing his letter being sent (found a dead body with the letter in hand, guess it could have arrived at [[Shu Sanctum]] rather than sent from there)

He cast aside his past duties and beliefs to seek certain powers (maybe red mercury). The negligence may have caused the [[Ancient Shu]] to resurface and unleash [[Feathering]] upon the world.

He trapped the Imperial Guard under the [[Shu Sanctum]]. A note from one of the guards says he will deliver him to [[Ming Dynasty]] for the potions he has been concocting.
