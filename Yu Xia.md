A maiden at [[Reverent Temple]]

Asked [[Wuchang]] to check if there is a cure for the [[Feathering]] at [[Shu Sanctum]] and if so to let her know.

A letter from [[Commander Honglan]] was sent to [[Yu Xia]]

Said that [[Liu Wenxiu]] took [[Zhang Xianzhong]]'s body to the [[Zhenwu Temple]] temple and is worried about what they are planning to do with it, asked [[Wuchang]] if she would check and return with information to the [[Reverent Temple]] where she will wait

She got word that [[Liu Wenxiu]] and his men butchered the temple priests and seized the temple, but not sure what they are plotting

When [[Commander Honglan]] succumbed to [[Feathering]] she kept talking about [[Yu Xia]], seems they had a close bond.

She mentioned the "true dragon" was about to be born and asked [[Wuchang]] if she was ready to serve the [[Ming Dynasty]]

Handed her the bag from [[Commander Honglan]] and she began weeping.
