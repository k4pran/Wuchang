Trying to find a cure for [[Feathering]]

Helped [[Wuchang]] recover in a temple after she lost consciousness due to [[Feathering]]

Guardian of [[Reverent Temple]]

[[Nian Suichang]] was seeing to [[Qiao Lin]] after his brother [[Nian Suichang]] give him all the blood at once, wished he had kept some to let him study it, but did say it helped alleviate the pain.

Decided to make his way to [[Doomwillow Beach]] after [[Wuchang]] discovered a secret passage to avoid the fires, he thinks the palace may hold the key to saving [[Worship's Rise]]

Wants [[Wuchang]] to investigate the [[Tang Emperor Palace]], the guards protect [[Xuanyangzi]] practice so didn't want to confront them himself, but suspects the palace is where the [[Feathering]] came from

Fleed from [[Madam Huang Yan|Madame]] when she kept wanting more [[Red Mercury]] for her research being afraid it would cause death

He "ascended", may have been trying to ascend like the [[Bo]] people instead of curing [[Feathering]] after all, but he became some [[Feathering]] monster

He said that [[Zhenwu Temple]] cast him aside, and turning his back on taoism and toward ascension was partly motivated by vengence. He also mentions that [[Commander Honglan]]'s infatuation helped pave his rise.
