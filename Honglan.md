Signed a letter written for a [[Reverent Temple]] maiden [[Yu Xia]].

It mentions [[Honglan]] sent his subordinates to the palace, and to keep an eye on the [[Burning Cave]] and mentions securing some relic. Planned to meet back at [[Reverent Temple]].

The letter was bloodstained so not sure it ever reached the maiden, or if the maiden ever reached the [[Reverent Temple]]. [[Wuchang]] ended up giving it to [[Yu Xia]]

The letter was found at top of [[Shu Sanctum]] where some succumbed to late-stage [[Feathering]] and there was blood everywhere so the letter didn't make it out of [[Shu Sanctum]]

Has some command or say over the [[Ming]] army it seems
